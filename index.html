        <h3>Working with react in this tutorial makes some assumptions about pre-requisite comfort with the
            development of websites in general:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You know how to connect to files root directories and make new files within that structure</li>
            <li>You have a working knowledge of terminal commands</li>
            <li>You have a grasp of react syntax and some experience using the language</li>
            <li>You have some experience with props and state</li>
            <li>You are comfortable with basic CSS and HTML and have working knowledge of JavaScript functions</li>
            <li>You can troubleshoot and debug if issues come up as you work through the tutorial steps</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="install_dependencies">
        <header class="heading">Install Dependencies</header>
        <p>For react applications, we will start by creating a react app from the terminal. This will auto install
            all of the required directories as you initialize the project. It is also possible to do this step
            manually. You are also welcome to substitute any name for your application after 'app' just remember it
            must be lowercase.
        </p>
        <code>$ npx create-react-app honeydo-react</code>
        <p>I prefer to begin in a folder already designated for my application, but you can also run
            these commands globally by inserting <code>-g</code> between the 'i' and 'create'. You can also complete this in two steps by using the following
            code:</p>
        <code>$ npm i -g create-react-app</code> <br/>
            <code>$ create-react-app honeydo-react</code>
        <p>You will also want to connect this repo to GitHub, so create a new repository on <a
                href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and if you need help, don't initialize with a README.md. The
            repo will give you directions to follow for linking to your react application. Once connected, you can
            check the current application build in your localhost by running the following:</p>
        <code>$ npm run start</code>
        <p>This should give you the following screen in your browser</p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="setup_app.js">
        <header class="heading">Setup App.js</header>
        <p>Let's remove all the react information built in so we can start building the application. Go into your
            'src' directory and find the 'App.js' file.
            <code>/src/App.js</code> </p>
        <p>You will see the following code:</p>
        <img src="images/app.js-code.png" alt="initial App.js code"/>
        <p>I am going to refactor this into React classes for the purposes of this tutorial. Delete the contents of
            the <code>App.js</code> file and add the following code instead:</p>
        <code><pre>
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
          &ltdiv className="App">
            &ltheader className="App-header">
              &lth1>
                Welcome to HoneyDo.
              &lt/h1>

            &lt/header>
          &lt/div>
    )
  }
}</pre></code>
        <p>Let's break down what we just did. In order to use react components, you must import them into each
            component page. The second import will pull in the CSS file already set up when you initialized the
            application. (We will eventually be updating this to reflect the CSS from the <a href="https://honeydo-app.herokuapp.com/">HoneyDo Django</a>
            application, but for now leave it.) In order to view any component, you must export the content. My
            preference is to include that in the extension of the Component itself so I don't forget, but you can also add it to the bottom of the code like this:</p>
        <code>export default App;</code>
        <p>The render piece is currently empty, but the return is what will allow the HTML code to display on the
            page. Right now it is simply a welcome message, and as long as the react server is running from the terminal
            (<code>$ npm run start</code>) you can return to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">localhost</a> to view the
            updated page.</p>
