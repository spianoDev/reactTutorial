        <h3>Working with react in this tutorial makes some assumptions about pre-requisite comfort with the
            development of websites in general:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You know how to connect to files root directories and make new files within that structure</li>
            <li>You have a working knowledge of terminal commands</li>
            <li>You have a grasp of react syntax and some experience using the language</li>
            <li>You have some experience with props and state</li>
            <li>You are comfortable with basic CSS and HTML and have working knowledge of JavaScript functions</li>
            <li>You can troubleshoot and debug if issues come up as you work through the tutorial steps</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For react applications, we will start by creating a react app from the terminal. This will auto install
            all of the required directories as you initialize the project. It is also possible to do this step
            manually. </p>
        <code>$ npx create-react-app honeydo-react</code>
        <p>I prefer to begin in a folder already designated for my application, but you can also run
            these commands globally by inserting <code>-g</code> between the 'i' and 'create'. Also note that the
            application name must be all lowercase. You can also complete this in two steps by using the following
            code:</p>
        <code>$ npm i -g create-react-app</code> <br/>
            <code>$ create-react-app honeydo-react</code>
        <p>You will also want to connect this repo to GitHub, so create a new repository on <a
                href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and if you need help, don't initialize with a README.md. The
            repo will give you directions to follow for linking to your react application. Once connected, you can
            check the current application build in your localhost by running the following:</p>
        <code>$ npm run start</code>
        <p>This should give you the following screen in your browser</p>
